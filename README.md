# PlotNodesOnGraph
Plots nodes based on dataset on a graph so you can visualize distances

# Install all imports in test.py (and have python and pip installed) and click run!

## Uses small python script to randomly (or non-randomly) choose a number of points to plot on a graph from the included dataset

The purpose of this repo is really for me to save my work while I test different traveling saleman algorithms
